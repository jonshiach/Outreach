    "[**Mathematical modelling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) is a description of a situation or scenario that is described using mathematical concepts. These models can be very useful as they can allow us to identify possible solutions without first implementing them in the real world. For example, NASA used mathematical models to predict the forces experienced by astronauts to see whether they could survive a trip into space. Here we are going to look at a type of mathematical model called an [**Agent Based Model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) which can be used to model the behaviour of a group of animals or people. Agent based models consist of a number of autonomous agents which are given a set of rules that govern the agents behaviour in the system. For example, an agent may represent a predator which is given a rule that it will chase the nearest prey. This Jupyter notebook will introduce you to agent based models and how can we write [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) programs to model complex behaviour. The programs are written for you but you can make changes to the parameters or even add to the programs if you wish.\n",

The position is given by a set of co-ordinates $(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are the horizontal and vertical distances from the bottom left-hand corner of the region.

During the time when the host is infected with the virus they can infect other people who are close by. \n",
