# Modelling a Zombie Outbreak

&copy; Dr Jon Shiach 2022

[Click here to download the Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/drjonshiach/Agent-Based-Modelling/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## About

This Jupyter notebook will introduce readers to a mathematical modelling technique called agent-based modelling where individual autonomous agents which could be a single animal or person are given rules to govern their behaviour. For example, in a social distancing situation each agent will want to avoid getting too close to another agent. We can use agent-based modelling to build mathematical models that simulate the motion of a flock of birds and the transmission of infectious diseases such as Covid or a zombie outbreak (unlikely to happen but you never know). 

## Running the notebook

You can run the Jupyter notebook file `Modelling a Zombie outbreak.ipynb` in one of two ways

### On your computer using the Jupyter notebook app

If you are able to install software on a computer the best way to work with Jupyter notebooks is to install the Jupyter app.

> ***Note:*** Do not try to run the `Modelling a Zombie outbreak.ipynb` file by double clicking on it in your file browser. You will need to open it from within Jupyter.

1. Download and install [***Anaconda***](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) onto your computer. Anaconda is a suite of open source apps including Jupyter notebook which is free to download and safe to do so.
2. Once you have installed Jupyter run the app. How to do this will depend on your operating system.
   - **Windows**:  select ***Jupyter*** from the start menu
   - **MacOS**: run ***Anaconda Navigator*** and then click on then ***Launch*** button beneath ***Jupyter Notebook***
3. A web browser window should open showing you the files on your computer. Navigate to the `Modelling a Zombie outbreak.ipynb` file and click on the file to open it.

### In the cloud using Google Colab

If you are unable to install software on a computer, or prefer to work in the cloud, you can run Jupyter notebooks using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). To do this you will need a Google account so if you do not already have one you can sign up [here](https://www.google.com/account/about/).

1. Open a web browser and go to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click on ***Sign in*** and enter your Google account details
3. Upload the file `Modelling a Zombie outbreak.ipynb` by clicking on ***Upload*** and select the file from where you stored it on your computer. Don't worry about upload any other files, these will be downloaded if necessary when you run the notebook.
