## About

This Jupyter notebook is designed to accompany a session which introduces you to the concept of chaos in mathematics. Whilst some of the mathematics required is ordinarily taught at degree level, to follow the content of this notebook you just need an understanding of differentiation and a little curiosity. This notebook contains some Python code to perform calculations and produce animations. No programming experience is necessary to follow the examples, however, readers can make changes to the code and execute to see what affects any changes has on the output.

## Running the notebook

You can run the Jupyter notebook file `Chaos with Python.ipynb` in one of two ways

### On your computer using the Jupyter notebook app

If you are able to install software on a computer the best way to work with Jupyter notebooks is to install the Jupyter app.

> ***Note:*** Do not try to run the `Chaos with Python.ipynb` file by double clicking on it in your file browser. You will need to open it from within Jupyter.

1. Download and install [***Anaconda***](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) onto your computer. Anaconda is a suite of open source apps including Jupyter notebook which is free to download and safe to do so.
2. Once you have installed Jupyter run the app. How to do this will depend on your operating system.
   - **Windows**:  select ***Jupyter*** from the start menu
   - **MacOS**: run ***Anaconda Navigator*** and then click on then ***Launch*** button beneath ***Jupyter Notebook***
3. A web browser window should open showing you the files on your computer. Navigate to the `Chaos with Python.ipynb` file and click on the file to open it.

### In the cloud using Google Colab

If you are unable to install software on a computer, or prefer to work in the cloud, you can run Jupyter notebooks using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). To do this you will need a Google account so if you do not already have one you can sign up [here](https://www.google.com/account/about/).

To run the notebook file `Chaos with Python.ipynb`

1. Open a web browser and go to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click on ***Sign in*** and enter your Google account details
3. Upload the file `Chaos with Python.ipynb` by clicking on ***Upload*** and select the file from where you stored it on your computer.
4. Click on the ***folder*** icon on the left side of the page and then on the ***upload*** icon and upload the file `animations.py` (from the same directory).
