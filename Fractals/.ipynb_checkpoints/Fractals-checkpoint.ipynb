    "[**Fractals**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) are complex and beautiful shapes that are generated using a simple set of mathematical rules. Fractals often exhibit a complicated structure which is repeated at different scales throughout the fractal, this means that if we zoom in on a portion of the fractal it will resemble the fractal itself. Mathematicians refer to this property as **self similarity** and can be seen in nature, some examples of which are shown below.\n",

We then remove the middle third of the line and replace it with two lines of length $\\frac{L}{3}$ which form two sides of an equilateral triangle. So after the first time we do this (stage 1) we have four lines each of length $\\frac{L}{3}$. We then repeat the process for each of the new lines.\n",

The Mandelbrot set is generated by using a very simple formula that is applied to complex numbers, so before we look at how it is generated we are first going to introduce you to complex numbers.\n",

    "Despite their name, complex numbers are actually quite simple. A complex number is a number that is expressed using two parts: a **real part** and an **imaginary part**. The real part is just a real number, the imaginary part is the **imaginary number** $i = \\sqrt{-1}$ multiplied by a real number. For example, the complex number $z = x + yi$ has a real part $x$ and an imaginary part $y$. We can think of a complex number as being a point on the complex plane where the horizontal axis represents the real part and the vertical axis represents the imaginary part. The distance of the point from the origin is known as the **absolute value** (or modulus) of $z$ and is denoted by $|z|$. Using Pythagoras' theorem we calculate the absolute value of a complex number using\n",

    "where $z_n$ is the current number in a sequence of numbers, $z_{n+1}$ is the next number, $z_0=0$ is the starting number and $c = x + yi$ is some complex number. The first time we calculate this equation we have $z_1 = c$, the second time we have $z_2 = c^2 + c$, the third time we have $z_3 = (c^2 + c)^2 + c$ and so on. This method of repeating a calculation the same equation is known as **iteration**. We continue to iterate this equation until either the absolute value of $z_n$ is greater than 2 or a maximum number of iterations has been reached. If $|z_n|>2$ then we say that the number $c$ has *escaped* and is not a member of the Mandelbrot set, else if at the end of the iterations the absolute value of $z_n$ is still less than 2 we say the number $c$ is a member of the Mandelbrot set and we mark this point on the complex plane. If we repeat this for other points in the complex plane a beautifully complex shape starts to appear.\n",
